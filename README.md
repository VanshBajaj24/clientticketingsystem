# Client Ticketing System

## Abstract

In the realm of customer service and support, effective management of client inquiries and issues is paramount for organizational success. A client ticketing system serves as a structured approach to streamline this process, ensuring timely resolution and customer satisfaction. The system acts as a centralized platform where clients can submit their queries or problems, which are then organized into tickets. Each ticket is assigned a unique identifier and categorized based on priority and type of issue. The ticket is passed on to the consultancy firm where the manager assigns the issue to the developer/consultant. The developer/consultant needs to update the status of the issue to the manager who is further answerable to the client. The system works with the help of Flask and MySQL for database management. By prioritizing efficiency, communication, and data-driven insights, businesses can foster stronger client relationships and achieve operational excellence.

## Features

- **User Authentication and Authorization:** Implementing secure login mechanisms for clients, managers, and developers/consultants.
- **Database Management:** Utilizing MySQL for efficient data storage and retrieval of ticket information.
- **REST API Development:** Creating RESTful APIs using Python Flask for seamless interaction between the front-end and back-end components.
- **Data Processing:** Employing Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation and analysis.
- **User Interface Design:** Developing an intuitive user interface for clients, managers, and developers/consultants to interact with the system.
- **Notification System: ** Implementing email or in-app notifications to inform users of ticket status changes.
